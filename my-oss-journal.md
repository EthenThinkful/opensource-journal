  - Completed my Open Sauced profile and reviewed public PRs of people contributing to Open Sauced.
  - Reviewed issues in app, hot, and api repositories.

- **Tasks completed**: 
  - Made my first contribution to open-sauced/guestbook by adding myself to the contributor list.
  - Raised an issue for text changes in open-sauced/docs.
  - took (.take) the above issue and issued my second PR as a fix to the issue.
  - Helped others get involved with open source through 100devs discord channel.
  - Attempted to get the api up and running locally.
  
  Did not get to:
  - Get involved more in the OSS community and the job hunt by applying for OSS internships/programs.
  - Raise an issue for load times (find repo that is causing slow load times) through a screen recording of the issue. See what I would need to learn to contribute to the fix.
  - Pick up my first issue (that I did not issue) that's already in the issues tab under "good first issue" and attempt to solve it (does not have to be an open-sauced repo).
